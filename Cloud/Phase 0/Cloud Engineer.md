# What is a Cloud Engineer

> (Notes taken from "From Zero to Cloud Engineer in 6 months" by GPS)

## Phase 1: Linux and Networking
The cloud is a bunch of Linux servers that are networked together, so knowing the foundations of both is pretty crucial.

A lot of networking tasks are done using Linux terminal commands
- Basic commands (cd, ls, touch, cp, rm, find, man)
- How to view logs
- How to use pipelines (pipe operator)
- How to install packages

> FOR NETWORKING: Computer networking course on FreeCodeCamp

## Phase 2: Programming
There are roles in cloud that are 100% programming-related, but also there are more administrative roles so knowing at least beginner-medium programming is crucial

Also, you should learn **Bash scripting**.

## Phase 3: Cloud Platform
One of the best ways to pickup a cloud platform and learn one is through a **certification**, because the guided learning the certification provides **is crucial**.

Things that you should be familiar at the ends of this phase:
- Understanding of best practices for cloud infrastructure, reliability, performance efficiency.
- How to grant access and provoke access to different users
- How to use object storage (s3, blob storage)
- How to setup a v-net, sub-nets, private IP addresses, etc.
- How to create a server-less HTTP API
