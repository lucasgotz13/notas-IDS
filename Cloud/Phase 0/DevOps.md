# DevOps Roadmap
## Phase 1: Cover the foundations
### Foundations
- Linux fundamentals
- Bash Scripting
- Git

## Phase 2: Cloud Basics
Choose between AWS or Azure (probably AWS)
Learn the basic concepts of cloud:
- Compute
- Storage
- Networking
1 to 2 months to master the concepts

Do not focus on certifications. BUILD PROJECTS

## Phase 3: DevOps specific concepts
One of the most important ones is IaaS (Terraform, Palumi).
Again, master the concepts rather than the tools.
Learn what the Infrastructure code is, why it exists and what problems it solves and how to use it for real life cases
1 Month to master these skills

## Phase 4: Containerization and Container orchestration with Kubernetes
Master the basics and fundamentals (1-2 months)
## Phase 5: CI/CD
Understand the concepts first and pick one of the tools (Jenkins, Github Actions, Gitlab CI)
To learn, build ACTUAL pipelines.
1-2 months

## Phase 6: Observability
Prometheus, Graphana, etc.
1-2 months.

# Mistakes
## Learn in a linear and isolated way
You don't have to learn technologies separately.
You take whatever you are learning and you combine it with everything else you already know and apply it to build real projects and use cases that you can think of and building on it continuously.
