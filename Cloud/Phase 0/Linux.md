## What is a package?
A package is a collection of files and applications.
Linux distributions have **package managers**

# Security
Linux users dont use antivirus. Some of the reasons are the following:
- Linux is buil secure from the ground up. The regular user is very limited when interacting with the system. To gain permissions, the user needs to enter **root mode**
- Linux is installed in between 3 - 5% globally, so it is pretty pointless to make a virus that affects Linux users.
